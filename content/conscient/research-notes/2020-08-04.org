#+SUMMARY: Notes from 2020-08-04

Worked through Axler exercises in section 3.F, 28-31.

- 28 :: Some general feeling of missing important results about null T', nothing when I reviewed chapter
- 30 :: Approached this by trying to prove there is a basis of V these lin ind functionals are dual of (turned out to be problem 31), the proof was a combination of commerelial and entational symbolic manipulation to build up the construction.

    List of vectors to "fill" the rest of the dimension ejudes out to the right.

    Snippet of construction: "Ï•_{3} must be non-zero for one of these" accompanied by entational list of v_{3}-v_{n}.

    Seems like conversational commerel + entational manipulation + looking for some feeling of "confirmation" (or lack of disconfirmation?).
