Hi, I'm Shea! Welcome to my personal website!

I'm VP of Engineering at [[https://about.scarf.sh/][Scarf]], helping open source maintainers and their users connect for better software and better relationships.

I am also working on [[{{< relref "/conscient/" >}}][ConSciEnt]], an effort to learn more about how consciousness works and see what I can build from what I learn. Right now I'm focused on understanding free will in my [[{{< relref "/conscient/projects/vultolysis.org" >}}][Vultolysis]] project.

I write longer-form sporadically on my [[{{< relref "/blog" >}}][blog]], and much shorter and less sporadically on [[https://twitter.com/shlevy][twitter]]. My username is ~shlevy~ on most sites.

I live with my wife and two sons in Durham, NH.
