Hi, I'm Shea! Welcome to my personal website!

My main focus is [[{{< relref "/conscient/" >}}][ConSciEnt]], where I'm trying to learn more about how consciousness works and use what I learn to make cool things.

I write longer-form sporadically on my [[{{< relref "/blog" >}}][blog]], and much shorter and less sporadically on [[https://twitter.com/shlevy][twitter]]. My username is ~shlevy~ on most sites.

I live with my wife Alyssa and two sons, Colton and Ori, in Durham, NH. We're proud founding families and partners of [[https://freecoast.org/][the Freecoast]].
