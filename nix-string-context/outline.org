* Background/motivation
** Disclaimer
** Nix: A DSL for writing bash scripts
** Build scripts and artifacts relate to each other, how to track?
*** Nix store: path references
*** Nix language: String context
* Semantic meaning of string with context
** Types of context
*** Source
*** Derivation output
**** All derivation outputs
** Set of store path identifiers
** Meaning of string depends on validity of its context
** Attribute set name vs bash command
** Store paths are opaque pointers, contain very little useful information in their intrinsic structure!
* coercions
** Everything's a string eventually
** coerceMore
** copyToStore
** String context vs toString vs drv attribute
* Impact of operators/builtins
** No context vs IFD vs context propagated
** paths vs "paths" vs strings
** Operator list
* Future considerations
** Context introspection
*** Opaque?
** Arbitrary metadata/derivation poisoning
*** Needn't strictly be paths! Almost an implementation detail.
