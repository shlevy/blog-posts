<p><a href="http://blog.shealevy.com/2011/05/06/objectivists-are-libertarians/">Friday's post</a> has stirred up a small bit of controversy in the comments, on Twitter, and on at least one <a href="http://blog.ariarmstrong.com/2011/05/why-im-not-libertarian.html">other blog</a>. Right now I'm in an unusual situation for me: I'm pretty confident in my conclusion, but don't really care at all that other Objectivists disagree with it. All in all, this issue isn't that important and to me it's a definite case where agreeing to disagree and moving on to other things is the right way to handle the situation. That being said, <a href="http://blog.shealevy.com/2011/05/06/objectivists-are-libertarians/#comment-198689651">one of the comments </a>on my post got me thinking about how I would define libertarian, so I thought I'd give that a shot here. I'm not terribly good at coming up with definitions, and to be honest I haven't really seen first-hand (because I haven't really thought about the issue, not because I think there is no need) the strong cognitive need for them in all cases, but this is what I've come up with:</p>
<blockquote><p>A libertarian is a person who believes that the initiation of force has no proper role in human society.<sup><a name="ref1" href="#1">*</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>The measurements omitted from my concept of libertarian include, among others, beliefs about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who (if anyone) should be responsible for enacting retaliatory force?</li>
<li>What lead the individual to accept his political beliefs?</li>
<li>What path should we take in getting from our society to a libertarian one?</li>
<li>Should the abortion of a fetus be considered initiating force against it, or should the prohibition of abortion be considered initiation of force against mothers?</li>
<li>Should sexual activity between an adult and a young minor be considered initiating force against the minor, or should the prohibition of such activity be considered initiation of force against the would-be sexual partners?</li>
</ul>
<p>That being said, there are many beliefs which <em>aren't</em> omitted from my view, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is an employer who requires working 16 hour days as a condition of employment initiating force against his <del>employers</del> employees [Edit 5/10 14:37]? No, not according to libertarianism.</li>
<li>Should there be a welfare system funded by coercion? No, not according to libertarianism.</li>
<li>Should businesses be bailed out with money obtained by coercion? No, not according to libertarianism.</li>
<li>Should any sexual activity between fully informed, mentally healthy, consenting adults be considered initiation of force? No, not according to libertarianism.</li>
<li>Should the fully informed, consensual consumption of any substance obtained through consensual trade or other non-forceful means be considered initiation of force? No, not according to libertarianism.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm fully open to the idea that my definition here is lacking or erroneous. I'm completely certain that the concept I have in mind is a valid one, and I'm pretty sure that the concept I have in mind is indeed "libertarian", but I'd love to hear if anyone has a word that better fits my concept here.</p>

<p><a name="1" href="#ref1">*</a>: For those who aren't familiar with Ayn Rand's theory of <a href="http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/definitions.html">definitions</a>, a definition does not need to state all of the common characteristics of the unit of the concept, nor can a concept be simply replaced with its definition. So don't take this to be a mathematical or computational type of definition.</p>
