<p>I have a post planned where I go into detail about the work I've put in over the past 5 years (especially in therapy) to build better habits and attitudes around productive work. For now, though, I just want to share a small victory that I feel exemplifies the progress I've made and what I hope, based on the past year or so, will be my new normal.</p>
<p>Several <a href="http://www.atlos.org/">ATLOSCon</a>s ago, I gave two talks that I didn't prepare for, and they were frankly terrible. I knew it at the time, and after getting feedback on the talk I decided I wouldn't propose another one unless I had already written up a full outline for the talk. I just submitted my first class proposal, and will hopefully be leading a discussion group this May about being an Objectivist in open source software communities.</p>
<p>On the surface, this doesn't seem like all that big of a deal. After all, in all that time I've been building a good life for myself, achieving a lot of planned goals and doing a lot of useful productive work, much of which was much harder than preparing this talk. So why is this special?</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposing this class was not directly necessary for any of my longer term goals. It didn't help me advance in my career, build my home, etc. I wanted to do it, and I think presenting will add to my life, but I could have easily decided not to with no direct consequences or even a feeling of having let myself down.</li>
<li>I had to break up the task into chunks worked on over time, with individual chunks not being trivial or busywork. I did not save it all until the last minute, I did not scramble, I did not half-ass any step.</li>
<li>My personal standards were higher than my requirements, and I still met them. I didn't have to do any brainstorming or research, and certainly didn't have to write up an outline, just to submit the proposal. I could have easily skipped those steps and told myself I'd finish them before the talk (and I might have been right), but I kept to my own goals.</li>
<li>I didn't happen to naturally fall into a place of intense focus or productivity for any of the work. I made a plan and decided when I wanted to work on each part, and when the time came I had to overcome inertia and a desire to put things off. I did so, and did so without making myself miserable, finding a way to value the work in the moment.</li>
<li>I've had a lot going on since deciding to give the proposal a shot, including traveling for a funeral and two weeks on an overnight shift. I could have very easily decided not to do it this year, and have been perfectly reasonable to do so. And I didn't let it add to my stress and overall it made my month better</li>
</ul>
<p>And the best thing about all that? It's about how I reasonably expected things to go, based on the progress I've made. I wasn't certain, but I would have been more surprised if I hadn't gotten everything finished than if I had. So, yeah, it seems small, and in the scheme of things it is, but I really feel like I will be able to look back on this little achievement as a sign of a new phase in this area of my life.</p>
