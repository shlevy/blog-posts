<p>In my first <a href="http://blog.shealevy.com/2010/10/17/thoughts-on-dr-john-mccaskeys-resignation-and-the-events-surrounding-it/">post</a> on this matter, I said that I would aim to spread my conclusions about the ARI wherever I thought appropriate in order to get people thinking about this issue and to encourage a change in the ARI's then-implicit policy. However, the situation has since changed significantly enough for me to reconsider that aspect of my post. I think the information publicly available, especially Dr. Peikoff's <a href="http://www.peikoff.com/peikoff-vs-an-ari-board-member/">public statement</a> and the ARI's <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=26109">public statement</a>, is enough for interested parties to come to their own conclusions. Moreover, that public information, combined with the way I have been treated by ARI employees and supporters, has resulted in me losing interest in discussing this matter further or working to change the ARI. Therefore, unless some major change occurs, this will be my last public word on this matter.</p>
