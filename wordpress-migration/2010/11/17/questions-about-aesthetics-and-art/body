<li>What is art? I'm particularly interested in what the essential distinguishing characteristics are, but the non-essentials are also important. I'd particularly like to find an answer to this that highlights the cognitive value in having and applying the concept.</li>
<li>Which of the following, if any, are art: music, theatre, architecture, interior design, decorative illustration, dance, cooking, stop-motion videos.</li>
<li>What is the role of art in man's life? Is it essential, or can a good life be lived without it? If it is necessary, what about man's consciousness necessitates it and what would happen without it?</li>
<li>In my experience, responses to art are largely automatic. What, if anything, is gained from understanding the genesis of those responses? Can anything be determined about a man's premises by knowing what types of art he values?</li>
<li>Can art alter subconscious premises?</li>
<li>Should knowing the methods or interpretations of the artist affect our response to his artwork?</li>
<li>Are any of these questions part of philosophy proper, or are they more properly thought of as philosophy of art?</li>
</ul>
