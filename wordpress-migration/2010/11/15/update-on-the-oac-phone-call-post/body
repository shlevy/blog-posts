<p>I have disabled the link to a recording of November 2nd's OAC call that an anonymous poster left in a comment on my recent post about that call. In response to legal communication, I have closed the comment thread on that post. While I retain my rights to change my mind, I do not intend to comment publicly on the topic of November 2nd's OAC call in the future. The comments on this post are closed as well.</p>
