<p>To all who subscribe to my blog in an RSS reader:</p>
<p>Due to an as-yet unidentified glitch, some of my private journal entries are showing up in the RSS feed. Until I can figure out how to fix this, please refrain from reading any posts marked as a journal entry.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Shea</p>
