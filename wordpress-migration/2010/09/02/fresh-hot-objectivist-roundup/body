<div><!-- EDIT THIS: carnival introduction begins with this paragraph: --> Welcome to the September 2, 2010 edition of the Objectivist Round-up! This is the 164th edition of a <a href="http://blogcarnival.com/bc/index.php">blog carnival</a> of posts written on any topic by authors who are <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_intro">Objectivists</a>, advocates of the philosophy of <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_ayn_rand_aynrand_biography">Ayn Rand</a>.</div>
<div>To learn more about Ayn Rand and Objectivism, I recommend reading her two most famous novels, <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> and <em>The Fountainhead</em>, or any of her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_adv_b/?search-alias=stripbooks&amp;unfiltered=1&amp;field-keywords=&amp;field-author=Ayn+Rand&amp;field-title=&amp;field-isbn=&amp;field-publisher=&amp;node=53&amp;field-p_n_condition-type=&amp;field-feature_browse-bin=&amp;field-binding_browse-bin=&amp;field-subject=&amp;field-language=&amp;field-dateop=&amp;field-datemod=&amp;field-dateyear=&amp;sort=relevanceexprank&amp;Adv-Srch-Books-Submit.x=31&amp;Adv-Srch-Books-Submit.y=13">non-fiction anthologies</a>. The <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=index">Ayn Rand Institute</a> is also a great resource. For just a taste of who Ayn Rand was, here's one of my favourite quotes of hers:</div>
<blockquote>
<div>To say "I love you" one must first be able to say the "I."</div>
<div>~Ayn Rand, <em>The Fountainhead</em></div>
</blockquote>
<div>Without further ado, here are this week's posts!</div>
