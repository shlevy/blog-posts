<p>I'm not exactly sure what made me think of this, but the other day while on a medium-length drive I realized that driving can be thought of as a low-pass filter on speed: The amount of time it will take you to get to the destination is much more affected by the slow but long-lasting changes in speed and not on the quick but oscillatory changes. Pursuing this line of thought further (the drive was pretty long), I realized that car-sickness can be thought of as a high-pass filter on speed: slow, long-lasting changes don't matter, but quick oscillatory ones have a big effect. I spent quite some time turning this over in my head, including recognizing the fact that the speed-time relation involved integrating speed and the speed-sickness relation involved differentiating it, and it was honestly a joy to find such a simple little connection. Really, though, it was a good demonstration for me of the power of integration (philosophical, not mathematical!).</p>
<p>Before making the (quite unexpected) connection between an abstract concept from signal analysis theory and a concrete daily action, I understood what filters were and how they worked, and I had a strong grasp on how changes in my driving speed would affect my overall trip, but now I can use the knowledge I have from both fields and apply it to both. When considering filters, I can concretize problems by relating them back to my very perceptual experiences with driving. On the flip side, if I ever want to take a more intellectual approach to driving (which I doubt will happen, but it might), I will be able to use my experience with signal theory to solve problems like "What's the best way to get to the destination quickly without making Alyssa sick?"</p>
<p>In the scheme of things, this integration was quite unimportant. But it really hammered home to me the fact that integration really is a (the?) vital cognitive tool in a really neat, fun way.</p>
