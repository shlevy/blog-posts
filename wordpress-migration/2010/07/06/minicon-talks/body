<p>I just got back from the <a href="http://www.atlantaobjectivists.com/">Atlanta Objectivist Society</a>'s <a href="http://www.atlantaobjectivists.com/minicon2010/">Mini-Con</a> (which was an awesome time, the subject of a later post), where <a href="http://www.atlantaobjectivists.com/minicon-presenters/#Shea">I</a> gave two talks: one aboutÂ <a href="http://www.atlantaobjectivists.com/minicon-class-desc/#Epist">practical benefits of epistemology</a> and one about <a href="http://www.atlantaobjectivists.com/minicon-class-desc/#MedDev">regulation in the medical device industry</a>. I recorded both and am posting them here, but I have two disclaimers first: 1. These were informal talks and I make no guarantees about any accuracy. Particularly with the medical devices talk, the particulars I discuss may not be perfect reflections of what actually is in the real world and are more reflections of my memory. 2. I have not edited these, nor listened to them all the way through. Some questions in the Q/A sessions may be difficult to hear; if you want me to try and clarify what was asked at that point give me the time in the lecture and I'll see if I can remember.</p>
