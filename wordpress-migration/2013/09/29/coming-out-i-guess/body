<script charset="utf-8" type="text/javascript" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async=""></script>This wasn't meant to be anything significant, but when my dad texted me "Curious to learn more about your latest tweet" I realized some people might not know I'm bisexual<sup><a href="#foot1" name="note1">1</a></sup>. It's never been a secret or anything, but it's only been true<sup><a href="#foot2" name="note2">2</a></sup> for a few years and I guess it hasn't come up with my parents, seeing as I was engaged and am now married<sup><a href="#foot3" name="note3">3</a></sup>. This isn't a big deal for me but I realize it might be for some, so I guess this is me letting everyone know.</p>

<p><sup><a href="#note1" name="foot1">1</a></sup>: More precisely, pansexual<br />
<sup><a href="#note2" name="foot2">2</a></sup>: Seriously, there was a specific point two years ago before which I wasn't attracted to guys and after which I was<br />
<sup><a href="#note3" name="foot3">3</a></sup>: Happily, I might add. This change had no significant effect on our relationship</p>
